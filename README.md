## Disclaimer: 
This bot was created for educational purposes. I am not responsible for any bans that result from using this program.

## Description:
The program casts the rod to the right of your character, searches for any alerts of fish on your first monitor, and reels it in. The program handles most errors like incorrect detection by recasting the rod. Large fish that take 30 seconds or more to reel in will not be caught and the program will recast the rod. Ideal for leveling up your fishing skill.

## Additional Details:
Press "q" to pause the program's loop <br>
Press "r" to resume the program's loop <br> 
Current graphic settings: <br>
Zoom level = 1, Zoom level 0 can sometimes yield better detection, experiement to find ideal settings. <br>
Fullscreen <br>
Res = 1920x1080 <br>
Target FPS = 30

## Future Plans
I do not plan to update this program. Feel free to edit/improve the code yourselves ðŸ˜„
